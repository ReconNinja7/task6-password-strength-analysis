#  Task 6 ‚Äì Password Strength Analysis

##  Overview
This task demonstrates password strength evaluation using **Kaspersky Password Checker**.  
Three different passwords were tested ‚Äî weak, medium, and strong ‚Äî to understand how password complexity impacts security.  
The analysis also covers best practices for creating strong passwords and common password attack methods.

### 1Ô∏è Weak Password
![Weak Password](password1_weak.png)

**Feedback:**  
- Password appeared in **leaked password databases**.  
- Lacks sufficient length and complexity.  
- Vulnerable to **dictionary attacks** and **brute force attacks**.

---

### 2Ô∏è Medium Password

**Feedback:**  
- Better than the weak password, but still appeared in leaked databases.  
- Includes symbols and numbers, but lacks sufficient length and randomness.  
- Could be cracked with **brute force** in a reasonable time.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Strong Password

**Feedback:**  
- No leaks found.  
- Contains **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters**.  
- Sufficient length makes it highly resistant to common password attacks.

---

## Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
1. Use at least **12‚Äì16 characters**.
2. Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters**.
3. Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns.
4. Never reuse passwords across accounts.
5. Consider using a **password manager** to store and generate passwords.
6. Change passwords periodically, especially after a breach.

---

##  Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack:** Tries all possible combinations until the correct one is found.  
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses a list of common words and leaked passwords to guess quickly.  
- **Credential Stuffing:** Uses previously leaked username-password pairs to access accounts.

---

##  How Password Complexity Affects Security
- **Short, simple passwords** can be cracked in seconds or minutes.
- **Complex passwords** with randomness and sufficient length can take **years** or even **centuries** to crack.
- Passwords not found in leaked databases are much harder to guess.
